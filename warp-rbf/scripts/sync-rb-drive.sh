Usage: zed-rbf/scripts/sync-rb-drive.sh [--dry-run] <command>

Mirror the .rb-drive directory to a Google Drive destination with rsync.

Commands:
  remote      Back up .rb-drive into .rb-drive-remote/.rb-drive/ (faithful private mirror).
  public      Publish .rb-drive contents (.agents/, projects/) into .rb-drive-public-share/ (VCS + secrets excluded).

Options:
  -n, --dry-run  Show what rsync would change, without writing or deleting.
  -h, --help     Show this help.

Environment:
  RB_DRIVE_MAX_DELETE  Max files one mirror may delete (default: 100).
